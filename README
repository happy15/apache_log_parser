What's this?
============
This module is intent to parse the most common log pattern 
for apache, nginx, etc.

Here we got two implementations:
1) use regex to parse the log, which is elegent, but slow
2) use string split to parse the log, which is way faster then 1)

How to use it?
==============
To parse a line of log, do:

parse('123.126.50.69 - - [03/Jan/2012:00:00:02 +0800] ' +
      '"GET /some/url/on/your/site HTTP/1.1" ' +
      '200 5876 "-" ' +
      '"User agent like Mozilla chrome or even spider(+http://www.spider.com/docs/help/webmasters.htm#07)"'))')
or:
fast_parse('123.126.50.69 - - [03/Jan/2012:00:00:02 +0800] ' +
      '"GET /some/url/on/your/site HTTP/1.1" ' +
      '200 5876 "-" ' +
      '"User agent like Mozilla chrome or even spider(+http://www.spider.com/docs/help/webmasters.htm#07)"'))')
